   ```

2. **No Development Environment**
   - Cannot install dependencies
   - Cannot run TypeScript compilation
   - Cannot execute tests
   - Cannot build the plugin

3. **Git Repository State**
   - Recent commits show cleanup/organization work
   - All source files appear to have been deleted
   - Repository in "cleaned" state but not rebuilt

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Issues:**

- **Implementation Gap:** Project cannot proceed without basic infrastructure
- **Timeline Impact:** Epic 1 Story 1.1 (Project Setup) must be completed first
- **Development Blocker:** No mechanism to write, test, or build code

**Medium Risk Issues:**

- **Dependency Management:** Need to establish proper npm package structure
- **Build Process:** Must configure dual ESM/CJS output for Node.js
  compatibility
- **Testing Framework:** Bun test integration needs initial setup

**Low Risk Issues:**

- **Documentation Quality:** Excellent foundation in place
- **Requirements Clarity:** Comprehensive and well-structured
- **Architecture Planning:** Detailed technical guidance available

## Conclusion

The stryker-mutator-bun-runner project demonstrates **exceptional planning and
architectural foresight**. The PRD, architecture documentation, and epic
breakdown are comprehensive and well-structured. However, the project currently
has a **critical implementation gap** - no source code, build configuration, or
development environment exists.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation immediately, starting with Epic
1 Story 1.1 to establish the basic project infrastructure. The excellent
planning foundation means once the infrastructure is in place, development can
proceed rapidly using the BMAD framework workflows.

**Next Steps:**

1. Execute `*create-story` for Epic 1 Story 1.1
2. Complete project setup and build configuration
3. Begin sequential implementation following the epic breakdown
4. Use BMAD workflows for story creation and validation

The project has strong potential for success given the quality of planning and
the capability of the BMAD framework. The immediate priority is bridging the gap
between excellent planning and executable implementation.
