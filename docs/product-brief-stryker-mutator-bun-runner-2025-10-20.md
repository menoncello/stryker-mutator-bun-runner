## Executive Summary

**Product:** `@stryker-mutator/bun-runner` - Native Bun test runner plugin for StrykerJS mutation testing framework

**The Opportunity:** Bun developers lack access to mutation testing, creating a critical gap in quality assurance for the fast-growing Bun ecosystem. StrykerJS, the industry-standard mutation testing framework, currently only supports Node.js-based test runners (Jest, Mocha, Vitest).

**The Solution:** A production-ready Stryker plugin that integrates Bun's native test runner, delivering extremely fast mutation testing (2-3x faster than existing runners) while maintaining full Stryker ecosystem compatibility. Leverages Bun's performance advantages through a hybrid subprocess architecture with intelligent test filtering via perTest coverage analysis.

**Target Users:** Bun-first developers seeking mutation testing capabilities without compromising on speed or switching runtimes.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Performance Leadership**: 2-3x faster than Jest/Vitest runners, making mutation testing practical for large codebases
- **Native Bun Integration**: First and only mutation testing solution optimized for Bun
- **Full Stryker Compatibility**: Complete TestRunner API implementation with perTest coverage (40-60% performance gain)
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean, maintainable design based on proven patterns with comprehensive technical validation

**Success Metrics:** Official adoption by Stryker team as `@stryker-mutator/bun-runner`, 500+ weekly npm downloads within 6 months, recognition as the standard mutation testing solution for Bun projects.

**Strategic Goal:** Become the reference implementation for Stryker test runner plugins while filling a critical ecosystem gap, with path to official Stryker team maintenance and support.

**MVP Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (Phases 1-2: Core plugin + Coverage analysis)

**Status:** Technical research complete, ready for implementation. Architecture validated through comprehensive research including ADRs, technology evaluation, and risk assessment.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**

The Bun runtime has gained significant traction as a fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, offering 2-5x performance improvements over Node.js. However, developers using Bun lack access to mutation testing capabilities through StrykerJS, the industry-standard mutation testing framework. This creates a critical gap in the quality assurance toolkit for Bun adopters.

**Impact:**

- **Bun developers cannot validate test suite quality** - No way to ensure tests actually detect bugs through mutation testing
- **Forced to switch runtimes** - Must use Node.js + Jest/Vitest runners to access Stryker, negating Bun's speed advantages
- **Ecosystem fragmentation** - Bun adoption slowed by lack of tooling parity with Node.js ecosystem
- **Lost productivity** - Teams waste time on slow mutation testing or skip it entirely

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

- **No Bun support** - Stryker's official runners (@stryker-mutator/jest-runner, @stryker-mutator/mocha-runner, @stryker-mutator/vitest-runner) only support Node.js-based test frameworks
- **Performance compromise** - Existing workarounds require running Bun tests through Node.js compatibility layers, eliminating speed benefits
- **Community gap** - No community-maintained Bun runner exists despite growing demand

**Urgency:**

Bun's adoption is accelerating rapidly. The Stryker team is receptive to ecosystem contributions. First-mover advantage exists for a well-implemented Bun runner that could become the official solution.

---

## Proposed Solution

**Core Approach:**

Build `@stryker-mutator/bun-runner` - a native Bun test runner plugin for StrykerJS that delivers extremely fast mutation testing by leveraging Bun's native performance while maintaining full compatibility with the Stryker ecosystem.

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Native Bun Speed** - Execute tests using Bun's native runtime (2-5x faster than Node.js-based runners), making mutation testing practically feasible for large codebases
2. **Full Stryker Integration** - First-class plugin implementing Stryker's TestRunner API with complete feature parity (perTest coverage, concurrent execution, timeout handling)
3. **Zero-Config TypeScript** - Leverage Bun's native TypeScript support - no transpilation configuration needed
4. **Modern Architecture** - Clean layered architecture (Hybrid Subprocess pattern) designed for maintainability and extensibility

**How It Works:**

- **Integration Layer**: Implements Stryker's Plugin API (TestRunner interface)
- **Execution Layer**: Spawns Bun CLI subprocesses via `Bun.spawn()` for isolated test execution
- **Coverage Layer**: Collects perTest coverage to enable intelligent test filtering (40-60% performance gain)
- **Result Parsing**: Translates Bun test output to Stryker's expected format

**Why This Will Succeed:**

- **Technical Validation**: Comprehensive research validates feasibility (see Technical Research Report)
- **Clear Architecture**: Well-defined implementation path with proven patterns from existing runners
- **Performance Advantage**: Unique value proposition - only mutation testing solution optimized for Bun
- **Ecosystem Fit**: Aligned with Stryker team's plugin architecture and contribution guidelines
- **Community Need**: Addresses real gap as Bun adoption grows

**User Experience:**

Developers simply install the plugin and configure Stryker to use the Bun runner - mutation testing "just works" with the speed they expect from Bun.

         └─────┘           └─────┘
```

**Key Architectural Decisions (from Technical Research):**

1. **ADR-001: Bun CLI Subprocess Execution**
   - Use `Bun.spawn()` for test execution (only viable option)
   - Clean process isolation per mutation
   - JSON output parsing for structured results

2. **ADR-002: Hybrid Coverage Approach**
   - Start with native Bun coverage + custom perTest collection
   - Istanbul as fallback option if needed
   - Pragmatic balance between speed and functionality

   - Spawn new Bun process for each mutantRun()
   - Guaranteed clean state
   - Trade performance for correctness

**Layer Architecture:**

1. **Stryker Integration Layer** - TestRunner interface implementation
2. **Orchestration Layer** - Test execution, coverage collection, mutation activation

   - PerTest provides 40-60% performance improvement
   - Requires test-to-mutant mapping during dryRun
   - Critical for practical mutation testing on large codebases

4. **Bun Test Runner Capabilities**
   - CLI-only (no programmatic API)
   - Built-in coverage (line/function, no branch)
   - Fast subprocess spawning via `Bun.spawn()` (60% faster than Node.js)
   - JSON output format available
   - Test filtering via `--test-name-pattern`

5. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Layered Adapter Architecture recommended
   - Process isolation pattern for mutation testing
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Reference implementations: Jest, Mocha, Vitest runners

**Three Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) Created:**

- **ADR-001**: Use Bun CLI Subprocess for Test Execution
- **ADR-002**: Hybrid Coverage Approach (Native Bun + Custom PerTest)
- **ADR-003**: Fresh Subprocess Per Mutation

**Recommended Technology Stack:**

- Plugin Framework: `@stryker-mutator/api`
- Process Management: `Bun.spawn()`
- Coverage: Native Bun coverage + custom perTest collection
- Language: TypeScript 5.x+
- Testing: Bun test (dogfooding)

**Implementation Roadmap:**

- Phase 1: Core Plugin (2-3 weeks)
- Phase 2: Coverage Analysis (3-4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (2-3 weeks)
- Phase 4: Advanced Features (ongoing)

### B. Stakeholder Input

**Primary Stakeholder: Eduardo Menoncello (Project Lead)**

**Vision:** Create extremely fast mutation testing solution for Bun developers, with goal of official Stryker team adoption.

**Key Requirements:**
- Native Bun support (no compromise on speed)
- Full Stryker ecosystem compatibility
- Production-ready quality
- Official adoption by Stryker team

**Success Criteria:**
- Plugin accepted as `@stryker-mutator/bun-runner`
- Listed in official Stryker documentation
- Community adoption and recognition

**Target Users:**
- Bun developers seeking mutation testing
- Teams adopting Bun who need quality assurance tools

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Open source contribution to established ecosystems
- Technical leadership in test tooling
- Community building and engagement

**Additional Stakeholders (Anticipated):**

- **Stryker Team**: Ecosystem maintainers, potential co-maintainers
- **Bun Team**: Runtime developers, potential collaboration on APIs
- **Bun Community**: Early adopters, testers, contributors
- **Stryker Users**: Potential users migrating to Bun
